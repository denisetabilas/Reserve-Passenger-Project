<member name="M:Project_5.frmDisplay.pdoc_PrintPage(System.Object,System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs)">
 <summary>
 PrintPage is the printing event. This event gets fired for every 
 page that will be printed. You could also handle the BeginPrint and EndPrint
 events for more control.
 
 The following is very 
 fast and useful for plain text as MeasureString calculates the text that
 can be fitted on an entire page. This is not that useful, however, for 
 formatted text. In that case you would want to have word-level (vs page-level)
 control, which is more complicated.
